# Frontend
I need a technical dashboard to help me execute TerminalBench runs in the web. The dashboard should allow me to:
- Upload tasks to be run
- Run tasks and view running tasks
- View results of completed tasks
- View current outputs of running tasks (like a terminal)
There will be 10 runs going at once per task, so you can have tabs for each run.

This is a NextJS app with all ShadCn UI components. Style it to be clean and simple. Make it dark mode.
